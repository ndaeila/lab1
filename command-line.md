# Exercise 1: Navigation

This exercise is an introduction to terminal command.
An example solution is in the _solution_ folder.

Try to achieve the following tasks.  When done, write the command you
used in this file underneath the particular question.

1. Open your terminal (command prompt), either gitbash on windows or
   terminal on mac.
   CMD-Space on mac to open Spotlight, then search for terminal.
2. Which directory are you in?  Find it out!  Hint: `pwd`

   ```
   pwd
   ```

   /Users/itadmin

3. Navigate to your "Documents" directory (or wherever else you keep
   your stuff).  Hint: `cd`

   ```
   cd Documents
   ```

4. Print out the working directory--are you in the correct place?

   ```
   pwd
   ```

   /Users/itadmin/Documents

   I am in the correct place.

5. List the files there.  Do you see the same files and in the file
   explorer?  Hint: `ls`

   ```
   ls
   ```

   I do see the same files in my file explorerm in the Documents directory.

6. Navigate back to the home folder.  Use the dedicated shortcut for
   home folder.  Hint `~`.

   ```
   cd ~
   ```

   It worked.

7. Commit and push your changes.

```
git commit -am "First Push Ever (in this repo)"
git push
```

8. Check the file on github--do you see your edits there?

Yes, I do see the edits there. Eureka!

Congrats!  You are done!
